As an app what do i do ?
```
This app is a property rental application that allows users to search for properties by location, price range, and number of guests. It utilizes React and React Router for the front-end and a mock API for the back-end.

The principal functions used in the app include state management, rendering of components, handling of user events, and navigation through React Router. The app is structured in a modular and reusable component-based architecture, with each component having its own file.

you'll find a map of the organization of the app in terms of folder and stuff , which i find really cool to understand it. and a precision of the different tools used to make it work,


```
How to install it ?
```
just npm install selecting the folder , it will as it say install all the dependancies needed to make the app work , don't forget to install the react cli.


```
How to start it ?
```
just open a terminal originating from the folder and tape npm start , the script will then do is job compile and launch the application and open a browser window directly on the app index/first page.


```
What are the words above do in short version ?
```

Index : The main component of the app, responsible for rendering the Header and Pages components, we call it the router since he grabbs everything from the differents folders and then display it

Header: The component responsible for displaying the header of the app

Pages: The folder containing the various pages of the app, including Home
